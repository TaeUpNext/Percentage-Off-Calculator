# What is this Program 
this program is a small discount calculator GUI you enter the price of the item at top the amount of discount % in the second entry box (such as 25 for 25% off) and then hit calculcate and it will give you the new price after the discount.

# What are the zipped files
They allow you to run the app without needing to run the actual source code. If oyu unzip dist you will see the .app file for the program you should just need that. In case that doesnt work unzip the build folder too which holds all the contents that it was built with and it should work then

# Future Features
Honestly don't have any but if you have any ideas comment and let me know!
